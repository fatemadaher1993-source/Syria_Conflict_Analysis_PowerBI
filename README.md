## 🎯 Project Goal

To move beyond simple event counting by establishing a **Conflict Severity Index** (Lethality Index) to better inform resource allocation for protection programming and transitional risk management in Syria.

## 💡 Key Analytical Findings

1.  **Extreme Lethality Risk in Tartous:** The analysis found that Tartous records the highest **Fatalities per Event (FPE)** of **3.74**, requiring specialized, targeted protection protocols.
2.  **Disparity in Risk Profiles:** **Idlib** faces a high **Frequency Risk** (most events), while **Deir-ez-Zor** faces a high **Impact Risk** (most fatalities).
3.  **Transitional Risk:** Identified the potential for post-conflict **vengeance cycles and sectarian violence** in high-impact areas, necessitating immediate Community-Based Conflict Resolution programs.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Modeling & ETL:** Cleaning, transforming, and connecting raw conflict data (`.xlsx`).
* **DAX Modeling:** Creating complex custom measures, most notably the **Fatalities per Event (FPE)** index.
* **Advanced Interactivity:** Implemented **Drillthrough functionality** (demonstrated in screenshots) to allow users to dive from the high-level Governorate view down to detailed analysis.
* **Visualization & Reporting:** Designed a **clean, professional Power BI Dashboard** with an integrated **Executive Summary** page for strategic communication and decision support.

## 📁 Files Included in Repository

* `Syria_Conflict_Analysis.pbix`: The source Power BI Desktop file.
* `syria_conflict_data.xlsx`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* `Screenshots/`: Contains visual output of the Dashboard, Executive Summary, and Drillthrough feature.
